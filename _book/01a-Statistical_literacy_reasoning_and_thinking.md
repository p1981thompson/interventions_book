# Statistical literacy, statistical reasoning and statistical thinking

In recent years, psychological science has realised that some commonplace research practices are just not working, revealing an extensive replication problem, often characterised as a crisis. Some high profile researchers have been campaigning for years, demonstrating that the replication problem exists and have made huge efforts to raise awareness. A growing proportion of psychological science is now actively searching for and implementing potential solutions that narrow the opportunity to use questionable research practices. For example, registered reports and preregistration are two such initiatives for confirmatory research that ensures that research questions, analyses, and data decisions are pre-specified as far as possible before any data is collected. Dorothy (Bishop) has referred to the four horseman of the replication apocalypse (HARKing, low power, P-hacking, and Publication bias).   

Secondly, there has been a surge in the uptake of new statistical methods, particularly in Bayesian statistics. This is a positive step for the field, but the heart of some of these replication problems is the lack of statistical knowledge of researchers. Caution is needed by researchers, and they should be wary of investing in new complex methods without adequate foundations of prerequisite statistical knowledge. The highly competent non-statistician who has a broad statistical knowledge may be quick to judge my last statement and conclude that I am suggesting that reseachers default to the formally trained statistician. On the contrary, this is the motivation for this book. Researcher training in statistics is currently not well setup to provide a complete statistical education that allows smooth transition to using more complex methods. The remainder of the book focuses on defining elements of statistical education in interventions.       

What do we mean by statistical reasoning, thinking and literacy? In the statistics education literature, we often find these terms used interchangably. However, we should note their subtle differences, highlight definitions and overlaps. @Chance_2002 provides a distinction between these terms as follows:

>While statistical literacy can be narrowly viewed as understanding and interpreting statistical information presented, for example in the media, and reasoning can be narrowly viewed as working through the tools and concepts learned in the course, the statistical thinker is able to move beyond what is taught in the course, to spontaneously question and investigate the issues and data involved in a specific context.

In addition, @delMas_2002 presents a table defining the component concepts contained in each domain.

Formal definitions can be found in @Rumsey_2002, @Garfield_2002, and @Chance_2002, which we restate here for convenience. 

## Statistical Literacy

@Rumsey_2002 reports several definitions of statistical literacy which she finds too broad, so considers two distinct sub-areas covered by statistical literacy. The first is *statistical competence* referring to basic knowledge that underlies statistical reasoning and thinking. More specifically, the required knowledge covers data awareness, statistical concepts and terminology, data collection and descriptive statistics, basic interpretation and communication. This would be the typical goal of a traditional undergraduate statistics course and as such leaves considerable scope for confusion and inadequate statistical training if not coupled with statistical reasoning and thinking. The second sub-area is *statistical citizenship* which Rumsey defines as "developing the ability to function as an educated person in today's age of information". Consequently, statistical citizenship also requires sufficient skill in reasoning and thinking.

Broadly, statistical Literacy is the basic mechanics of statistics (nuts and bolts of the machine). A individual can be taught to be statistically literate and has the ability to run a particular routine analysis but lacks the sufficient knowledge to know if the analysis is appropriate, correct, or meets assumptions. 

## Statistical Reasoning

@Garfield_2002 provides a comprehensive review of the definition of *statistical reasoning* as found in the literature. The most appropriate that we will refer to here is as follows:

> ...statistical reasoning as what a student is able to do with statistical content (recalling, recognizing, and discriminating among statistical concepts) and the skills that students demonstrate in using statistical concepts in specific problem solving steps.

More specifically, the steps can be characterized by the following process:

 - Comprehension (seeing a particular problem as a similar to a class of problems)
 - Planning and execution (applying appropriate methods to solve the problem), and
 - Evaluation and interpretation (interpreting the outcome as it relates to the original problem)
 

## Statistical Thinking

@Chance_2002 

## Relationship between concepts.

Figure 1 shows two examples of the potential theoretical relationship between these concepts, first presented in @delMas_2002. Neither are an idea representation, the true relationship will likely be more fluid and depend on the relative weights of each concept according to the statistical method being learnt. For example, a highly complex method might require substantial literacy burden but reasoning of the method might be much more straight forward. Conversely, we might have a much simpler method which requires a minimal literacy requirement, but has a greater requirement of thinking and reasoning skills to adequately understand.

The traditional approach to teaching statistics involves a substantial amount of time dedicated to the derivation of statistical tests from first principles. Students will follow the lecturer explaining the various terms and mathematical operations required to obtain a test statistic and the ultimate goal of a p-value (we will revisit p-values and the current debate later). This traditional approach has several significant drawbacks when taught in the typical time constrained format of most science-based subjects. Firstly, if we think in terms of our earlier definition of the components of statistical knowledge, then we find this approach will only provide a reasonable grounding in statistical literacy. However, if taught without substantial statistical reasoning and thinking content in parallel, even the most competent student can be left feeling daunted and confused. Secondly, if any course begins with complex mathematical notation heavy content, we potentially miss a substantial opportunity to motivate and inspire the student. The question that we often hear from students is "why?", they need context around those methods and secondly, "which?" as in the current framework they require substantial knowledge of lots of methods to choose the appropriate one. An analogy, imagine that you are searching for your perfect house, you don't need to know every house currently on the market to make the right decision. You can, however, make an informed choice if you know what your constraints are, for example, what's your budget? (sample size), you need three bedrooms (multivariate or univariate), near to a good school (Bayesian or frequentist), etc.. which sufficiently narrows your options and from that point you can use more refined details to further narrow to your ideal choice. 

Anyone that has been to see a statistician and come away feeling frustrated is, in our experience, as a result of the statisticians answer to the question "What analysis should I use?" which our first response is "it depends, what research question do you want to answer?". This highlights the difference in thinking towards finding the appropriate analysis. The statistician or in fact any statistically compentent person (sometimes referred to a 'parastatistician') is wanting to refine the criteria for selection by knowing the constraints according to the proposed research question and the data. @Lakens_2019 refers to the statistician's fallacy which he defines as "they[statistician] declares which statistic researchers really 'want to know'. Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask". Throwing down this gauntlet for the statistics community is likely to be met with some reservations as it is not an easy fix, but it is possible given a receptive environment to change on both sides (statisticians and researchers alike). Education of statistical concepts is severely lacking. In the authors' opinion, it is typically missing essential core principles and usually delivered in the wrong order and with an emphasis on the wrong concepts (typically, notation, mechanics of tests, and dichotomous interpretation without full understanding of p-values). This should be the first order of business in re-educating researchers and reforming statistical practive in science. Abandoning existing practices that are the foundation of science, as it exists currently, will cause more damage in the long term. Similarly, adding more and more complex methods to an already questionable teaching syllabus will be equally damaging. A more phased transition from the reliance on p-values as the sole source of information is required. Building a stronger understanding and developing stronger reasoning skills than are currently present in science.   

The alternative proposed is to offer a more complete statistical education and starting with reasoning skills.

Why preregistration and registered reports are the statisticians friend. From a statistician's point of view, preregistration is the framework that allows us to be most helpful, no data has been collected so it is not too late to make adjustments that could scupper the study. We can estimate statistical power and refine some of the criteria for data collection and better understand all the requirements for a successful study. Teaching statistics with preregistration in mind is a very intuitive way to incorporate building reasoning and thinking skills into any course syllabus.
