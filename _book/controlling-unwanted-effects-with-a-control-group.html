<div id="controlling-unwanted-effects-with-a-control-group" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 5</span> Controlling unwanted effects with a control group</h1>
<p>The idea of a control group has already come up in chapters 3 and 4, where it has been noted that this provides one way of estimating how far an improvement from baseline to post-treatment is really due to the intervention. The logic is straightforward: if you have two groups â€“ group A who has the intervention, and group B who does everything that group A does except for the intervention, then it should be possible to isolate the specific effect of the intervention. In this chapter I will discuss the different kinds of control group that can be used. But first, it is important to address a question of ethics.</p>
<div id="is-it-ethical-to-include-a-control-group" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Is it ethical to include a control group?</h2>
<p>The argument against a control group goes something like this: we think our intervention works, but we need to do a study to establish just how well it works. It would be unethical to withhold the intervention from one group of people because they would then be deprived of a potentially helpful treatment.</p>
<p>This argument has as many holes in it as a Swiss cheese, and hereâ€™s why. Do you already know if the treatment works? If the answer is Yes, then why are you doing a study? Presumably it is because you think and hope it works, but donâ€™t actually have evidence that it does. So you donâ€™t know and you need to find out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the kinds of systematic bias discussed in Chapter 3 often lead practitioners to have an unwavering conviction that their intervention is effective: they see improvement in the clients they work with, and assume it is because of what they have done. The harsh reality is that when properly controlled studies are conducted, it is often found that the intervention is not effective and that the improvement is just as great in controls as in the intervention group. There are numerous examples of this in mainstream medicine, as well as in speech and language therapy. Box x gives some examples.</p>
<div id="possible-adverse-effects-of-intervention" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Possible adverse effects of intervention</h3>
<p>Worse still, some interventions do more harm than good. The need to evaluate adverse impacts of intervention is well-recognised in mainstream medicine, where it is easy to see the increased risks of morbidity or mortality, or unpleasant side effects. In speech and language therapy it is typically assumed that interventions wonâ€™t do any harm â€“ and it is true that types of adverse effect seen in medicine are not likely. Nevertheless, any intervention creates opportunity costs â€“ the time (and sometimes money) that are spent in intervention canâ€™t be spent doing other things. I first became sensitive to this issue when trying to persuade head teachers to get involved in a computerised intervention I had devised: they were keen to take part, but then discussed with me what activities children should miss if they were to spend 15 minutes every day on my computerised tasks for a period of six weeks. Should we ask children to forfeit their breaks, or to skip non-academic activities such as swimming? This would hardly be popular with the children, we felt. Or should they take time out of lessons in English or Maths? As discussed in Box 1 (FFW and Arrowsmith and Cogmed) some computerised programmes involve a substantial investment of time.
When we move to consider interventions outside the school setting, there are still time costs involved: an aphasic adult with poor mobility or a harassed mother with three small children who is reliant on public transport may have considerable difficulty making it to clinic appointments. You may reply that, even if the intervention is ineffective, the clients are glad to have the attention and professional interest of a therapist. But if that is something that is of importance to them, then that needs to be included in your outcome measures â€“ i.e.Â you need to demonstrate it is so, rather than just assuming this is so.</p>
<p>For parent training programmes, there is an additional risk of making parents worry that they are inadequate, and that their childâ€™s difficulties are all their fault. Clearly, competent professionals will be at pains to counteract that perception, but it is an easy mindset to fall into. (Box on media reaction to Jonathan Green study?).</p>
<p>Finally, the person who is the focus of intervention may feel embarrassed, stressed or stigmatised by being singled out for special treatment â€“ this is most likely to be a potential problem for children who are pulled out of regular classes for intervention sessions. Here again, a good professional will recognise that risk and do their best to address the concerns, but this needs to be thought about, rather than blithely assuming that because the intention of the therapist is good and helpful, their impact has to be beneficial.</p>
<p>All these potentially adverse impacts, including the large investments of time associated with the kinds of intervention shown in Box x, will generally be seen as a price well worth paying if the intervention is effective. At the end of the day, a decision whether to intervene or not should involve an appraisal of costs and benefits. Unfortunately, it is all too common to completely ignore the costs and to adopt a rosy, but unevidenced, view of benefits.</p>

<div id="uncontrolled-studies-are-unethical" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Uncontrolled studies are unethical</h3>
<p>As explained in Chapter 3, a study that just compares people on a language measure before and after intervention is generally uninterpretable, because there are numerous factors that could be responsible for change. Having a control group is not the only way forward: in Chapter x, I discuss other types of research design that may be more appropriate for specific contexts. But in most situations where the aim is to test the effectiveness of an intervention for a particular condition, a study with a control group will be the best way to get useful information. Indeed, doing a study without controls is unethical, because you end up investing the time of clients and professionals, and research funds, doing a study that cannot answer the question of whether the intervention is effective.</p>

<p>As noted above, a common design is to compare group A, who receive intervention, with group B who are treated just the same but without any intervention. If you see no effect of intervention using this design, and the study is big enough to give adequate statistical power (see Chapter x), then you can be pretty certain that the intervention is not effective. But if you do see a reliable improvement in group A, over and above and change in group B, can you be certain it was the intervention that made the difference?</p>
<p>There are two things to be concerned about here. First, in the previous chapter I discussed the kinds of very general impact that can be caused just by being in an intervention group. These work in the opposite way to the possible adverse effects discussed above: although some people may be embarrassed or stressed by being a target of intervention, others may be reassured or made more confident. A good therapist will do more than just administer an intervention in a standard fashion: they will form a relationship with their client which can itself be therapeutic. This, however, creates a confound if the control group, B, just has â€˜business as usualâ€™ because it means we are really comparing group A, who gets a specific intervention plus a therapeutic relationship, with group B, who gets nothing.</p>
<p>A creative way of dealing with this confound is to ensure that group B does also get some kind of intervention, but different from the one that is the focus of the study. For instance, (Snowling study) compared children who had a parent-reading intervention with a group who had a parent-based intervention designed to improve motor skills. Box X shows other examples (social vs language? Dental care? â€“ Gillam study?) It is important to choose a comparison intervention that is not expected to have an impact on the main outcome measure â€“ otherwise you could find yourself in a situation where everyone gets better but groups A and B donâ€™t differ, and you are left uncertain whether both interventions worked or neither did.</p>
<p>The use of a contrasting intervention overcomes another possible concern about untreated controls, which is those in group B may actually do worse because they know they are missing out on an intervention that might be able to help them (see Chapter 4).</p>
