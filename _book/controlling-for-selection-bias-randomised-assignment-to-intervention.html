<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> Controlling for selection bias: randomised assignment to intervention</h1>
<p>In chapter 6, we saw how observational studies could be misleading because they are likely to contain unknown differences between intervention and control groups. Recognition of this limitation led to the development of the randomised controlled trial as a gold standard approach to the evaluation of interventions. The core idea is that once a target population has been identified for study, the experimenter allocates participants to intervention and control groups in a way that avoids any bias.</p>
<p>There is a quite substantial literature on methods of allocation to intervention. The main principle behind modern intervention studies is that allocation should be completely random, i.e.Â not predictable from any characteristics of participants. There are many approaches to treatment allocation that are designed to avoid bias but which are not random. For the time being we are ignoring the question of who does the randomisation: this will be discussed in Chapter 8. We also defer until later the question of recruitment and what to do about people who do not wish to take part in a trial. We assume we have a population of potential participants and have to decide who will be in the intervention group and who will be in the control group. Consider the following methods of allocation and note your judgement as to whether they are (a) reasonable ways of avoiding bias and (b) random.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Allocate people to the intervention group until the desired sample size is reached; then allocate all subsequent cases to the control group</li>
<li>Allocate the more severe cases to the intervention group and the less severe to the control group</li>
<li>Alternate between intervention and control: thus the first person on the list is an intervention case and the last one is a control</li>
<li>For each potential participant, toss a coin and allocate those with â€˜headsâ€™ to the intervention group and those with â€˜tailsâ€™ to the control group</li>
<li>Create pairs of people matched on a key variable such as age, and then toss a coin to decide which will be in the intervention group and which in the control group</li>
<li>Create pairs of people matched on the baseline score on the outcome measure, and then toss a coin to decide which will be in the intervention group and which in the control group</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have read this far, it is hoped that you will identify that B is clearly a flawed approach. Not only does it fail to equate the intervention and control groups at the outset, it also is likely to result in regression to the mean, so that greater gains will be seen for the intervention vs.Â the control group, for purely spurious statistical reasons. Despite its obvious flaws, this approach is sometimes seen in published literature â€“ often taken to the extreme where an intervention group with a disorder is compared to a â€˜controlâ€™ group with no disorder. This makes no sense at all â€“ you are not controlling for anything unless the groups are equivalent at the outset, and so cannot evaluate the intervention this way.</p>
<p>Approach A is an improvement, but it is still prone to bias, because there may be systematic differences between people who are identified early in the recruitment phase of a study and later on. For instance, those who sign up immediately may be the most enthusiastic. Approach A also creates problems for blinding, which is discussed further in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>Most people think that Approach C as a reasonable way to achieve equal group sizes and avoid the kinds of â€˜time of recruitmentâ€™ issues that arise with Approach A. But this is not a random approach and would therefore be regarded as problematic by modern standards of trials design. One reason, which I will discuss at more length in Chapter 8, is that this method could allow the researcher to influence who gets into the study. Suppose the experimenter allocates aphasic patients to a study to improve word-finding according to some systematic method such as their serial order on a list, but notices that the next person destined for the intervention group has particularly profound difficulties with comprehension. It may be sorely tempting to ensure that he had an â€˜oddâ€™ number rather than an â€˜evenâ€™ number and so ended up in the control group. Similar objections arise to methods such as using a personâ€™s case number or date of birth as the basis for intervention assignment: although this may be a fixed characteristic of the person and so appear to avoid bias, it raises the possibility that the experimenter could simply decide not to include someone in the study if they were destined for the intervention group and looked unpromising.</p>
<p>Approach D is clearly random, but it runs the risk that the two groups may be of unequal size and they may also be poorly matched on the pre-intervention measures, especially if sample sizes are small.</p>
<p>Approach E would seem like the logical solution: it avoids unequal sample sizes, ensures groups are comparable at the outset, yet includes randomisation. This method does, however, have some disadvantages: it can be difficult to apply if one does not have information about the full sample in advance, and can be problematic if participants drop out of the trial, so the matching is disrupted.</p>
<div id="units-of-analysis-individuals-vs-clusters" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Units of analysis: Individuals vs clusters</h2>
<p>In the examples given above, allocation of intervention is done at the level of the individual. There are contexts, however, where it makes sense to use larger units containing groups of people such as classrooms, schools or clinics. Research in schools, in particular, may not readily lend itself to individualised methods, because that could involve different children in the same class receiving different interventions. This can make children more aware of which group they are in, and it can also lead to â€˜spill-overâ€™ effects, whereby the intervention received by the first group affects other children who interact with them. It may make sense for children in classroom A to have one intervention and those in classroom B to have a control intervention. This is what happens in a clustered trial.</p>
<p>This method, however, raises new problems, because we now have a confound between classroom and intervention. Suppose the teacher in classroom A is a better teacher, or it just so happens that classroom B contains a higher proportion of disruptive pupils. In effect, we can no longer treat the individual as the unit of analysis. In addition, we may expect the children within a classroom to be more similar to one another than those in different classrooms, and this has an impact on the way in which the study needs to be analysed. Clustered studies typically need bigger sample sizes than non-clustered ones. We will discuss this issue further in Chapter 10.</p>
